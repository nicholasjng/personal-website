## And here we go!

I first thought about making my own website back in early 2020, but things did not fall into place. First, my thesis (naturally) took the bulk of my time, and in hindsight, simply put, I did not have anywhere near enough experience to successfully manage and execute this project.

But since then, some time has passed, and I have made progress in a lot of areas. I finished my thesis and my degree, and started working with [an awesome group of guys](https://maiot.io/) in a Munich-based MLOps startup. Both of these really opened up some entirely new worlds for me!

## Retrospective

Throughout 2020, I met and worked with many people who are passionate about their jobs, both in research and in tech. I would say that drawing inspiration from them and channeling it to accelerate my own personal growth was something that finally "made things click" for me.

At this point, I want to thank the people that influenced me, motivated me and helped me get this project done. You are awesome, and no matter how it happened, in the end, you helped me a lot. I really, really appreciate it :-)

## Outlook

Looking forward, there are some exciting things to do! As you can see in the header, I created multiple themed sections, which I plan to fill with different stories and pieces over the course of the next few months.
Especially the photography part is something I wanted to do for a long time.

Furthermore, I decided to make the code for this website open source, so that it can serve as a starting point for someone who wants to make their own website as well, and is not shy about web development. 

This concludes my first blog post. I'm really excited to see what this year has in store, and I hope you have a great 2021 in spite of the current pandemic situation. Catch you all in the next one!

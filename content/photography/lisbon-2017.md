So I have always been a big fan of Scandinavia in general. I went to Bergen, Norway to study via the Erasmus program,

Eiffel (the tower guy) spanning across to its sister town of Vila Nova de Gaia. That is also the one on the cover of this post!

## Day 2: Guided tour and journey to Lisbon

This day was split into two main components. After the breakfast, we embarked on a guided tour spanning the old town along with some other places. The
